redux is globle state management tool

instead of redux we are using redux-toolkit

store----> its a collection of reducers 
reducer ---> its a collections of actions
actions ---> its a collection of functions
state -----> its basically a value which will change later like useState

why redux toolkit ?
we dont have to manage reducers conditions in redux toolkit 

two hooks to use reducers 

useSelector ---> fetch the state 

useDispatch --> send the data in state / update the state


Step 1 ---> create a store.js 
step 2 ---> define createstore and export it.

step 3----> provide store to root component 
step 4----> use Provider Component for wrap app component in main.jsx file
step 5---> send store which we are defined in store.js as props to provider

step 6---> create Slice for perticular module
